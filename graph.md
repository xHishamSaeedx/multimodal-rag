Design a **semantic, hierarchical Neo4j graph**, not a sentence-level one. Represent each document as a single `Document` node connected to a small set of `Section` nodes (chapter headings or logical segments). Each section links to a handful of tokens `Chunk` nodes that serve as your retrieval granularity. Instead of cluttering the graph with every sentence, extract only meaningful `Entity` nodes—people, organizations, concepts, locations, metrics, or domain-specific terms—and connect chunks to these entities via a simple **MENTIONS** relationship. Add **ABOUT** edges from sections to their top few entities, and optional **RELATED_TO** edges only between entities that strongly co-occur or truly relate semantically. Images, tables, or charts become `Media` nodes attached to their chunks via **HAS_MEDIA**, and optionally to entities via **DESCRIBES**. The result is a compact, expressive graph where structure runs vertically (Document → Sections → Chunks) and meaning runs horizontally through sparse, high-value entity relations—fast to build, fast to query, and perfect for RAG.
